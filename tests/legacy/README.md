# Legacy Scripts

These are older versions of the script that have been superseded by `html_to_mp3.py`.

## TextToMp3.py
Simple clipboard-to-MP3 converter. Reads text from the system clipboard and converts it to audio.

## paserHTML.py  
Basic HTML-to-MP3 converter. Simple version that extracts text from HTML files without advanced metadata extraction or content cleaning.

Both scripts are kept for reference but are no longer maintained.
